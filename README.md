# Conducting Business

This is an effort to adapt the USMC Doctrine "Warfighting" to create a
doctrine for conducting business.

Many passages will seem very similar. This is a tongue-in-cheek observation
that conducting business and war share similar traits. Generally any
organizations with the will and means to influence other groups (violently
or not) will face similar challenges.

We hope that this work will lead to helpful insights.
