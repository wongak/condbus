# Conducting Business

## The Nature of Business

To understand this group's philosophy of conducting business, we first need an
appreciation for the nature of business itself - its moral, mental and physical
characteristics and demands. A common view of business among members of this
group is a necessary base for the development of a cohesive doctrine because
our approach to the conduct of business derives from our understanding of the
nature of business.

### Business defined

Business is the organized efforts and activities of individuals to produce
and sell goods and services for profit. These groups are traditionally
incorporated entities but other informal groups can exist - with their own
interests and means to act on the market.
Profit is not necessarily monetary. Non-profit organizations or political 
parties for example seek profit in other areas. These groups will still have 
the power, will, and means to influence businesses with significant 
consequences.

The essence of business is the meeting of two independent, critical wills,
each trying to find terms which benefit them. Business if fundamentally an
interactive social process. Business is thus a process of contiuous mutual
adaptation, of give and take, move and countermove. It is critical to keep in
mind that the actors are not inanimate objects to be acted upon but independent
and animate forces with their own objectives and plans. While we try to
influence other actors, they resist us and seek to influence us. Appreciating
this dynamic interplay between human wills is essential to understanding the
fundamental nature of business.
